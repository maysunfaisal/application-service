# GitOps Generation

The generation of GitOps resources is handled by the go module [redhat-developer/gitops-generator](https://github.com/redhat-developer/gitops-generator). Please refer to the module's README for more information on the usage.

### Development

When working on a story that requires contribution to [redhat-developer/gitops-generator](https://github.com/redhat-developer/gitops-generator), replace the gitops-generator go module's path in your local `go.mod` with a gitops-generator repository's local path to ensure application-service is working as expected.
